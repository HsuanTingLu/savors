2. Preparation

    2.1. $PATH

        The dot and mscgen executables of Graphviz and Mscgen,
        respectively, must be available during configuration/execution
        either through the standard system paths or an appropriate value
        of $PATH.

    2.2. $PERLLIB

        The Perl module prerequisites must be available during
        configuration/execution either through the standard Perl
        module directories or an appropriate value of $PERLLIB.

    2.3. $PYTHONPATH

        The Python module prerequisites must be available during
        configuration/execution either through the standard Python
        module directories or an appropriate value of $PYTHONPATH.

    2.4. GeoLite City database

        The GeoLite City database must be uncompressed from gz/xz
        format after download and placed in an appropriate directory
        (e.g. /usr/share/GeoIP)


3. Installation

    Installation uses the standard configure/make process.  The
    configure command can be given an installation prefix via --prefix
    (defaults to /usr/local), a perl installation prefix via --plprefix
    (defaults to /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_lib/$PERLVER), and the full
    path to the uncompressed GeoLiteCity database (geolocation functions
    unusable if not given).  For example, the following would install
    Savors into /usr using the GeoLite City database in
    /usr/share/GeoIP:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr --citydb=/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat
        make
        make install


4. Configuration

    Settings global to all users can be placed in /etc/savorsrc.
    Settings local to a single user can be placed in ~/.savorsrc and
    will override global settings.  Some settings such as the geometry
    and save_X settings will be stored in ~/.savorsrc when changed
    within the console with the old file moved to ~/.savorsrc~.

    4.1. anon_key

        The anon_key setting (e.g. anon_key examplekey) specifies the
        string to use for anonymizing IP addresses and host/user names.
        This setting is only intended for ~/.savorsrc.

    4.2. debug_file

        The debug_file setting (e.g. debug_file /home/user1/dbg.txt)
        specifies the destination file for debug output.  Note
        that this setting only has an effect when debug lines are
        manually placed within the code.  This setting is only
        intended for ~/.savorsrc.

    4.3. displays

        The displays setting (e.g. displays localhost:0,mon2:0)
        specifies a comma-separated list of host:display pairs to use
        for the given layout specified by the wall setting.  This
        setting is only intended for ~/.savorsrc.

    4.4. font_size

        The font_size setting (e.g. font_size 16) specifies the font
        size of the console editor and related items.

    4.5. frame

        The frame setting (e.g. frame 1) specifies that window frames
        should be used on all view windows.  By default, window frames
        are not used, which conserves space, but does not allow windows
        to be manipulated outside the console.

    4.6. geometry

        The geometry setting (e.g. geometry 1024x640+400+400) specifies
        the X11 geometry for the console window, which will be saved
        whenever the size of the console is changed.  This setting is
        mainly intended for ~/.savorsrc, but can be used in the global
        settings to specify an initial geometry.

    4.7. lib_dir

        The lib_dir setting (e.g. lib_dir /usr/lib/savors) specifies the
        location of various Savors auxiliary files.  This setting would
        normally be set in /etc/savorsrc for system-wide installs and
        ~/.savorsrc for user installs.  In either case, it should
        correspond to $PREFIX/lib/savors, where $PREFIX is the value of
        --prefix given to configure.

    4.8. smaxx

        The smaxx setting (e.g. smaxx 0.5) specifies the maximum
        percentage of a display's width that should be used for views.
        This setting is only intended for ~/.savorsrc when a single
        display is used for the both the console and views.
        It is also applicable when Xinerama/XRandR combine multiple
        displays

    4.9. smaxy

        The smaxx setting (e.g. smaxy 0.5) specifies the maximum
        percentage of a display's height that should be used for views.
        This setting is only intended for ~/.savorsrc when a single
        display is used for the both the console and views.

    4.10. snap_file

        The snap_file setting (e.g. snap_file /home/user1/snap.ps)
        specifies the file used to save snapshots taken with the C-s
        binding in view windows.

    4.11. tcp

        The tcp setting (e.g. tcp 1) specifies that TCP sockets should
        be used instead of the default UNIX sockets.  This is only
        needed on systems that don't support UNIX sockets or for
        multi-host multi-display setups where views run on different
        hosts than the console.  Note that data is not encrypted over
        TCP so this mode is only intended for local networks.

    4.12. wall

        The wall setting (e.g. wall 2x4) specifies the layout (columns
        by rows) of the displays given by the displays setting in row
        order (i.e. all columns of each row are mapped to displays in
        order before the row after).  This setting is only intended
        for ~/.savorsrc.

    4.13. save_X

        For a given name X, the save_X setting (e.g. save_hello env
        repeat=1 echo hello word |rain) stores a command line that may
        be loaded into console editor using ":r X".  This setting is
        automatically created in ~/.savorsrc when using ":w X" in the
        console to save the current command line.  It can be used in
        /etc/savorsrc to store useful command lines accessible by all
        users.
